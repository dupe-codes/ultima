#### @March 2024

This update is belated; the changes I describe took effect almost two months ago. I'm officially back living in New York City. The move took what felt like a thousand years, but I'm happily all settled. I've also made a job change, starting a new software engineering role at Arena AI. I'm working on greenfield projects applying transformer models to the process optimization, validation, and configuration challenges abundant in manufacturing industries. The role comes with the promise of truly full-stack work â€” in the modern AI platform sense of the term â€” across data processing pipelines, model training efforts, model deployment, and user-facing product integration. I'm wary of AI's effects and usefulness in some domains, but the one I'm now working in feels eminently impactful.  

I'm still settling into my new routine, but I'm spending my days actively learning on the job while continuing my personal studies in the mornings and evenings; I really can't ask for much more.

My sabbatical has come to a close, and I've returned to my data platform engineering day job. In my free time, I'm focused on moving back to NYC (after quite a long sojourn in the Florida suburbs) and continuing the formal verification, compilers, and programming language studies in which I made so much progress during my time at the Recurse Center. Once settled in the city, I'm due for serious career and personal reflection. I want to chart a path for myself over the next four years that places me on pioneering, breakthrough projects at the frontiers of technological progress. Until then, I hit the books, and I code ðŸ’».

I've taken a leave of absence from my day-job for a coding sabbatical at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com). Over the next three months, I'll explore formal verification, kernel development, and compilers, while diving deeper into math studies. I go into more detail in [[2 - off on a coding adventure]].
