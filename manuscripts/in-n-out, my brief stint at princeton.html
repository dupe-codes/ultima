<p>In the Fall of 2020, I started a Computer Science master’s program at
Princeton. By January, I’d decided to step away from it. Because the
weeks leading up to and directly after the decision were a whirlwind,
I’ve never committed to writing exactly why I made it. So, here’s an
attempt at finally doing just that.</p>
<h2 id="goodbye-princeton">Goodbye, Princeton</h2>
<h3 id="i-was-disillusioned-with-tech.">I was disillusioned with
tech.</h3>
<p>Crypto enthusiasm was beginning to reach its fever pitch. It felt
like the culmination of almost a decade of watching my contemporaries
buy into a technology that I believed to be inconsequential at best and
fraudulent at worst¹. The Trump era had put a tight microscope on the
dangers and failures of the social media tech titans. Facebook/Meta was
starting to pump up the hype of the “metaverse,” another technical
investment that, while initially attractive, I questioned the actual
value of. All around me, the drawbacks and absurdity of the 2010s tech
world were being laid bare. I felt a genuine disinterest in the field,
and I couldn’t help but question what the actual worth of the work I had
done in the past was and what the value of the work I would do in the
future would be if I remained in a computing role.</p>
<h3 id="zoom-university-was-exhausting-and-isolating.">Zoom University
was exhausting and isolating.</h3>
<p>I went from living immersed in the frenetic energy of New York City
among friends to being alone in the suburbs of Plainsboro, New Jersey.
Most of the time, my fellow Princeton classmates appeared to me as empty
black boxes in a Zoom lecture. We were still in the pre-vaccination age
of COVID, so I didn’t feel comfortable venturing onto campus to
participate in the handful of in-person gatherings my master’s cohort
coordinated. It was the perfect capstone to a dismal year spent alone,
and I had legitimate worries about my ability to soldier on.</p>
<h3 id="i-couldnt-commit-to-a-particular-research-area.">I couldn’t
commit to a particular research area.</h3>
<p>I viewed the masters as a stepping stone toward a Ph.D. At no point
during the application process of writing personal statements, looking
up research labs, soliciting letters of recommendation, etc., did I feel
the kindlings of a research interest that seemed strong enough to
warrant throwing myself at it for years. Nor did such an interest
materialize during my time as a new student, taking my fall courses or
talking one-on-one with professors.</p>
<h3
id="i-realized-my-career-decisions-were-driven-by-the-pursuit-of-recognition.">I
realized my career decisions were driven by the pursuit of
recognition.</h3>
<p>And focusing on external motivations meant ignoring my internal wants
and desires. This contributed to all the struggles and angst I’ve listed
thus far. In particular, it was a massive part of why I felt so burnt
out by tech; I’d lost sight of my intrinsic interests in the field and
computer science more broadly, with all its concepts, rich ideas, and
exciting applications. Is it any surprise that I felt so uneasy,
undirected, and unhappy? I mused on those feelings and reflected on what
my heart wanted, which led to the next factor…</p>
<h3 id="i-felt-a-gnawing-hunger-to-draw.">I felt a gnawing hunger to
draw.</h3>
<p>Art has been an on-again-off-again passion since I was young, and I
retreated to it for comfort at the start of the pandemic. My excitement
for it starkly contrasted with my dejected attitude toward tech. I
wanted nothing more than to study art, and the fact that if I did decide
to step away from graduate school, I would have the means and
opportunity to focus on that entirely was too compelling to ignore.</p>
<h3 id="how-i-feel-today.">How I feel today.</h3>
<p>We’re coming up on the second anniversary of my decision, and I’m
happy to say that I don’t (yet) regret it. In the nine months
immediately after, I spent time with family and <em>rested</em>, the
sort of rest that reaches into your soul to uplift you, the kind you can
only get by truly <em>stepping away</em>. And I took online drawing
courses from artists I had long admired, a practice I’ve fortunately
been able to maintain after picking up a new job.</p>
<p>Speaking of the new job, I’ve been there for a year now, and while
there have been a few lows, it’s helped me rediscover what it was about
software engineering that initially drew me in.</p>
<p>Leaving graduate school was scary, but I did it. It was the right
choice.</p>
