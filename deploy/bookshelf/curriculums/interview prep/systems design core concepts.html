    <h3 id="the-standard-data-intensive-application-building-blocks">the
standard data intensive application building blocks</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>store data (databases)</li>
<li>Remember results of expensive compute (caches)</li>
<li>Allow users to search or filter data (search indexes)</li>
<li>Send asynchronous messages to other processes (stream
processing/message queues)</li>
<li>Run compute on large amounts of accumulated data (batch
processing)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="primary-concerns-in-data-systems">primary concerns in data
systems</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>reliability
<ol type="1">
<li>The system should perform work correctly in the face of
adversity.</li>
<li>faults vs failures
<ol type="1">
<li>fault: a component of a system deviating from its spec</li>
<li>failure: the system as a whole stops providing its required
service</li>
<li>The goal is to design systems that prevent faults from causing
failures.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>hardware faults
<ol type="1">
<li>add hardware redundancy (RAID disk configurations)</li>
<li>add software fault-tolerance techniques (e.g. multiple machine
configurations)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>software errors
<ol type="1">
<li>can cause large scale systemic failures; e.g., runaway process
eating up all share resources, cascading failures, etc.</li>
<li>usually reveals that the software has some assumption about its
environment that is not always true</li>
</ol></li>
<li>human errors
<ol type="1">
<li>design systems that minimize opportunities for errors</li>
<li>decouple places where people can make mistakes from production
(sandboxes)</li>
<li>test thoroughly</li>
<li>allow quick recovery (configuration rollbacks)</li>
<li>setup details monitoring</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>scalability
<ol type="1">
<li>As the system grows, there should be ways to deal with the
growth.</li>
<li>directly ties to direct questions; e.g., “what happens if the system
grows in <em>this</em> particular way?”</li>
<li><em>describing load</em>
<ol type="1">
<li>use numbers called <em>load parameters</em>; e.g., requests per
second, ratio of reads to writes, number of concurrent users…</li>
<li>think of averages and peaks</li>
<li>can be preferable to do work at write time to optimize reads;
depends on ratio of reads to writes, though.</li>
<li>also important to consider the <em>distribution</em> of load
parameters (e.g., heavy hitters)</li>
</ol></li>
<li><em>describing performance</em>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>throughput</em>: the number of actions executed per time
unit</li>
<li><em>response time</em>: the time between a client sending a request
and receiving a response</li>
<li><em>latency</em>: the duration that a request is waiting to be
handled</li>
<li>It is usually better to use <em>percentiles</em> to describe
performance metrics than <em>averages</em>.</li>
<li><em>Tail latencies</em> are important; the high percentiles of
response time.</li>
<li>Queueing delays often account for a large part of high percentile
response time.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><em>coping with load</em>
<ol type="1">
<li>Scaling up and scaling out</li>
<li>Some systems are elastic; automatically add/remove resources to
reflect increases/decreases in load</li>
<li>Distributing stateless systems is fairly straightforward; stateful
ones much less so.</li>
<li>A system that handles 10,000 requests per second at 1Kb in size must
look very different than one for 3 requests per minut at 2 GB in size,
even though <em>they have the same throughput</em>.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>maintainability
<ol type="1">
<li>Many different people should be able to work on the system
productively</li>
</ol></li>
