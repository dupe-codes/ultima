        <p>A collection of notes and study resources for software engineering
technical interviews.</p>
<p>I want to eventually lift up the notes in here that are more
generally useful (e.g., the notes on concurrency and parallelism) and
place them in another section of this website. But, for now, this will
be a huge dumping ground of technical knowledge!</p>
