        <p><strong>New Metropole, 100 years post-Rupture.</strong> Thanks to the
Gendermerie’s vigilance and the Inquisition’s blood magic, Metropolitans

Disintegration Disease. Meanwhile, the Crusade marches on, extending the
reach of The Consulate ever outward and bringing ever more peoples under
its watchful care. To some, humanity seems to be entering a Utopian age.
The Rupture may even be more a blessing than a curse, a boon replete
with gifts delivered courtesy of the Entity whose voice whispers from
its depths. But for these gifts, what is expected in return?</p>
