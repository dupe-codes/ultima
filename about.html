    <h3 id="about-me">about me</h3>
<p>Iâ€™m Nick ðŸ‘‹ Youâ€™ll see me around the world-wide-web asÂ <em>dupe</em>,
a nickname I gained growing up; I was often the second Nick to join the
class/workplace.</p>
<p><em>I draw, make games, tell stories, and code.</em></p>
<p>I graduated from Stanford with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2016 and
worked as a software engineer at the financial technology startup <a
href="https://addepar.com/">Addepar</a> until late 2020. At Addepar I
focused on core data processing algorithms and only directly triggered
two â€” maybe three â€” production incidents. After time off to selfishly
indulge my art practice, I worked as a senior software engineer on the
data platform team at <a
href="https://www.attentive.com/">Attentive</a>. Now, Iâ€™m at <a
href="https://www.arena-ai.com">Arena AI</a>, helping to build
artificial intelligence systems for manufacturing processes and
continuing my streak of only working for companies that start with the
letter A.</p>
<p>My main technical interests lie in programming languages, compilers,
low-level systems programming, game development, math, and algorithms.
Iâ€™m also a history fanatic particularly interested in 19th and 20th
century revolutionary periods.</p>
<p>You can reach me at <a
href="mailto:dupe@dupe.codes">dupe@dupe.codes</a>. Iâ€™m open to
correspondence on any of my interests and opportunities for
collaboration.</p>
