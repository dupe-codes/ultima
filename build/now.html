<p>Time for something newâ€¦</p>
<h4 id="march-2024"><span class="citation"
data-cites="March">@March</span> 2024</h4>
<p>This update is belated; the changes I describe took effect almost two
months ago. Iâ€™m officially back living in New York City. The move took
what felt like a thousand years, but Iâ€™m happily all settled. Iâ€™ve also
made a job change, starting a new software engineering role at Arena AI.
Iâ€™m working on greenfield projects applying transformer models to the
process optimization, validation, and configuration challenges abundant
in manufacturing industries. The role comes with the promise of truly
full-stack work â€” in the modern AI platform sense of the term â€” across
data processing pipelines, model training efforts, model deployment, and
user-facing product integration. Iâ€™m wary of AIâ€™s effects and usefulness
in some domains, but the one Iâ€™m now working in feels eminently
impactful.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m still settling into my new routine, but Iâ€™m spending my days
actively learning on the job while continuing my personal studies in the
mornings and evenings; I really canâ€™t ask for much more.</p>
<h4 id="november-2023"><span class="citation"
data-cites="November">@November</span> 2023</h4>
<p>My sabbatical has come to a close, and Iâ€™ve returned to my data
platform engineering day job. In my free time, Iâ€™m focused on moving
back to NYC (after quite a long sojourn in the Florida suburbs) and
continuing the formal verification, compilers, and programming language
studies in which I made so much progress during my time at the Recurse
Center. Once settled in the city, Iâ€™m due for serious career and
personal reflection. I want to chart a path for myself over the next
four years that places me on pioneering, breakthrough projects at the
frontiers of technological progress. Until then, I hit the books, and I
code ðŸ’».</p>
<h4 id="august-2023"><span class="citation"
data-cites="August">@August</span> 2023</h4>
<p>Iâ€™ve taken a leave of absence from my day-job for a coding sabbatical
at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com">Recurse Center</a>. Over the
next three months, Iâ€™ll explore formal verification, kernel development,
and compilers, while diving deeper into math studies. I go into more
detail in [[2 - off on a coding adventure]].</p>
