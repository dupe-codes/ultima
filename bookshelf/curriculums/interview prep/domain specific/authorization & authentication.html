        <h2 id="authorization-vs-authentication">Authorization vs
Authentication</h2>
<p><em>Authentication</em> confirms users are who they say they are.</p>
<p><em>Authorization</em> confirms that users have access to the
resource they are requesting.</p>
<h2 id="jwt-tokens">JWT Tokens</h2>
<p>Token generated by a server and issued to a client for the purposes
of authentication. The server signs the token using a private key;
clients are then responsible for providing the token in HTTP
authorization headers on API requests, along with the public key to use
to validate the tokens authenticity.</p>
<p>JWT is json based, and any data can be included in the payload for
the purposes of authentication; e.g., the ID of the authenticated user
can be included.</p>
<p>In a JWT flow, the provided token to the server contains everything
it needs to authenticate the user. This differs from a session flow,
where provided cookies must be matched with data elsewhere (on the API
server, in a separate session store, etc.) to authenticate.</p>
<p>JWTs are encoded, not encrypted, so sensitive information should not
be stored in them. For that reason they should also be transmitted over
secure SSL/TLS connections.</p>
<p>JWTs also include in their data signatures that can be used to verify
token integrity; e.g., the the data in the token has been tampered, it
will no longer match the signature.</p>
<h2 id="where-to-store-user-permissions">Where to store user
permissions?</h2>
<p>One option is to place them in the user JWT tokens, though care must
be taken if those tokens are transmitted via HTTP headers. Servers
usually set a limit on the size of HTTP headers accepted (say, 8
KB).</p>
<p>Serverside authoization checks against an authorization server (can
be third party, such as Okta Auth0) are a good alternative.</p>
