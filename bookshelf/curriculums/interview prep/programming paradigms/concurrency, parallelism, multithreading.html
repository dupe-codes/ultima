        <p>High level notes on concurrent and parallel programming.</p>
<h2 id="processes-vs-threads">Processes vs Threads</h2>
<p>A <em>thread</em> is an independent sequence of execution. A
<em>process</em> is a container for at least one thread of execution,
along with all other resources needed for computation.</p>
<p>They both operate as constructs for managing parallel computation,
but at different access levels. Most important to note is access to
virtual memory.</p>
<p><em>Processes</em> are each assigned separate sequences of the
virtual memory address space with which to operate. The operating system
enforces that one process cannot access the virtual address space of any
other.</p>
<p><em>Threads,</em> however, operate <em>within</em> a process, with
shared access to its memory address space. That means multiple threads
can access the same memory.</p>
<h2 id="concurrency-vs-parallelism">Concurrency vs Parallelism</h2>
<p><em>Concurrency</em> is a program/system property where multiple
tasks can run in overlapping <em>time periods</em>. They need not
actually run at the exact same instant.</p>
<p><em>Parallelism</em> is a behavior that occurs when at least two
tasks are executing <em>at the exact same instant.</em></p>
