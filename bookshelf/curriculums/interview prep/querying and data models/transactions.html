        <p>A <em>transaction</em> is a way to group several reads or writes of
data into a logical unit. It succeeds (commit) or fails (rollback,
abort). Through transactions, databases provide <em>safety
guarantees</em>.</p>
<h2 id="acid">ACID</h2>
<ul>
<li>Atomicity
<ul>
<li><em>atomic</em> = something that cannot be broken down into smaller
pieces.</li>
<li>In databases, this describes what happens if a client wants to make
several writes, but a fault occurs in the middle of them. If a fault
occurs, a transaction is aborted, and the database discards any writes
it has made so far.</li>
<li>If a transaction is aborted, an application can safely retry.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Consistency
<ul>
<li>There are certain <em>invariants</em> about your data that must
always be true.</li>
<li>If a database starts with these true, and a transactions writes
preserve the validity, the invariants will always be satisfied.</li>
<li>The application must define its transactions correctly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Isolation
<ul>
<li>Concurrency problems (race conditions) can occur if multiple clients
access the same database records.</li>
<li>Concurrently running transactions are isolated from each other: they
can’t step on each other’s toes.</li>
<li><em>Serializability</em> means each transaction can pretend it is
the only transaction running at the time. When concurrent transactions
are committed, the results are the same as if they had been run
serially.</li>
<li>Serializable isolation carries a performance penalty.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Durability
<ul>
<li>Once a transaction is committed, any data it wrote will not be lost,
even if there is a hardware fault or database crash.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="implementing-acid">Implementing ACID</h2>
<ul>
<li>Atomicity can be implemented using a log for crash recovery, and
isolation with a lock on each database object.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="classes-of-db-concurrency-issues">Classes of DB concurrency
issues</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Dirty reads: when one transaction is able to see data written by
another <em>that has not yet been committed</em>.</li>
<li>Dirty writes: when one transaction overwrites an uncommitted value
from a concurrent, uncommitted, transaction.</li>
<li>Read skew: when a transaction reads different values for the same
data during its execution because other concurrent transactions have
modified it.</li>
<li>Lost update: occurs if an application reads some value from the DB,
modifies it, and writes back the modified value. If two transactions do
this concurrently, one of the modifications can be lost.
<ul>
<li>some databases provide atomic update operations to solve this</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Write skew: caused by updates to separate records in a database that
none-the-less cause a conflict. Occurs if two transactions read the same
objects, and then update some of those objects. General case of dirty
write or read skew.</li>
<li>Phantoms: another specific type of write skew, where a write in one
transaction changes the result of a search query in another
transaction.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="isolation-levels">Isolation Levels</h2>
<h4 id="read-committed">Read Committed</h4>
<p>Default setting in many databases (e.g., PostgreSQL)</p>
<p>Two guarantees:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>When reading, you will only see committed data (no <em>dirty
reads</em>).</li>
<li>When writing, you will only overwrite data that has been committed
(no <em>dirty writes</em>).</li>
</ol>
<p>Dirty writes are most commonly prevented with <em>row-level
locks</em>.</p>
<p>Dirty reads are prevented by remembering both the old committed value
and the new value set by an in progress transaction. Reads are given the
remembered old value until the writing transaction is committed.</p>
<h4 id="snapshot-isolation">Snapshot Isolation</h4>
<p>Read committed guarantees + no <em>read skew.</em></p>
<p>Each transaction reads from a consistent snapshot of the database. It
sees all data as it existed in the DB at the start of the
transaction.</p>
