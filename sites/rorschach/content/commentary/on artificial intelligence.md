- An unfortunate name for _algorithms_
- the technology is impressive. The great aleph of all human knowledge, with grand approximate recall.
- I am dismayed at the societal impacts and havoc to be wrought. The death of the written internet. No longer able to trust your eyes, RLHFâ€™d to the perfect fash aesthetic
- I lament the death of _craft_. The joy in the art of doing. The joy in _caring_. 
- I do not want to off load my problem solving and critical thinking skills to AI. Use it sparingly. Do not use it to figure things out. Use it in a targeted way to get over the line once the hard parts are out of the way.
