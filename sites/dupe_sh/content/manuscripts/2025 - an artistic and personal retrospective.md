What an abysmal year, 2025... I entered it fully prepared to bear witness to nightmares, and boy did it deliver. Society buckled around me as I struggled with battles in my personal life. But even as I sat waiting to see if slapdash attempts at authoritarian consolidation succeeded and navigated personal hardships, I achieved victories, strides, accomplishments, and progress. Here I choose to focus on those, for this 2025 retrospective.
