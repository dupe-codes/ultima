My attempt at cataloging the disparate variations of technical interviews one might encounter. 

I often feel overwhelmed by the overall problem space of "software engineering technical interviewing." This is my attempt at controlling for that overwhelm, by discretizing that state space. 

## coding

### algorithms/data structures 

a.k.a. leetcode

### "practical" coding 


## systems design

### classical end-to-end application design

e.g., "build a photo upload and feed application"

### API design & data modelling

e.g., "design the APIs, data models, and overall user flows for a multiplayer chess website"
