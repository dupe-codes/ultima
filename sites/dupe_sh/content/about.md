### about me

I'm Nick ðŸ‘‹ You'll see me around the world-wide-web asÂ _dupe_, a nickname I gained growing up; I was often the second Nick to join the class/workplace.

*I draw, make games, tell stories, and code.*

I graduated from Stanford with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2016 and worked as a software engineer at the financial technology startup [Addepar](https://addepar.com/) until late 2020. At Addepar I focused on core data processing algorithms and only directly triggered two â€” maybe three â€” production incidents. After time off to selfishly indulge my art practice, I worked as a senior software engineer on the data platform team at [Attentive](https://www.attentive.com/). Now, I'm at [Arena AI](https://www.arena-ai.com), helping to build artificial intelligence systems for manufacturing processes and continuing my streak of only working for companies that start with the letter A.

My main technical interests lie in programming languages, compilers, low-level systems programming, game development, math, and algorithms. I'm also a history fanatic particularly interested in 19th and 20th century revolutionary periods. 

You can reach me at [dupe@dupe.codes](mailto:dupe@dupe.codes). I'm open to correspondence on any of my interests and opportunities for collaboration.
